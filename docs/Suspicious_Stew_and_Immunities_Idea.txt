(Milk Bottles)
- Milk Bottles replace Milk Buckets in the cake recipe and are acquired by milking a cow with an empty bottle

- Milk Bottles on their own do nothing, but if you are to feed a cow a flower and THEN milk them, you will get a milk bottle that provides immunities


(Immunity)
- When you drink a Flower Milk Bottle, you become immune to whatever effects correspond to the flower in this chart

- Immunity lasts a short while, and the duration can be increased by drinking more of the same Milk Bottle type

- You can only have one immunity active at a time. Essentially you just have one slot

- Immunity will not get rid of negative effects; it only makes the effects not effect you. Your immunity timer can run out before your negative effects timer


(Changes)
- Suspicious Stew will give only short-lived negative effects based on flower type

- All Cows and Mooshrooms can eat flowers now

- 1 flower equals 1 Suspicious Stew or Immunity Milk Bottle. When fed a flower, the cow will have potion particles around it until milked

- Milk Buckets will now only cure positive and neutral effects

- Suspicious Stew gives the player 1 more hunger than Mushroom Stew

- 1 mushroom equals 1 stew. No more infinite food via Mooshroom
